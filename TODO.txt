- Okay, first off let's list off what is actually *done* at this point:
  - zsh seems to be good for now (I don't really need the omz stuff I had)
    - I probably do need to add a hook for sourcing from a directory though
  - starship is on par with dotconfar

- Todo backlog is therefore:
  - deal with some more programs
    - 
    - git config is incomplete, figure out what's missing
    - 
  - backlog stuff / open questions
    - how much of my xsh is needed if I'm switching to nix-first?
  - futz with nix itself:
    - move `home.nix` to a `home-manager` directory
    - figure out how to name flake attributes so that my top-level can
      contain both home-manager configs and nix-darwin configs
    - bootstrap a nix-darwin config
    - once I get back to CA, make an intel darwin setup
    - once I get back to work, start building out an x86 linux setup


- Figure out how to factor things out of home into helper functions / modules
  - Split out git, and add more config
  - Split out zsh, and add more config(?)
- Fix the warning by unifying home-manager and nixpkgs versions
- Add starship soon, that's the last thing I really need to feel unstuck

- At that point I could maybe pause and try to actually start some kind
  of flake-based project - probably an ocaml or python PL toy
